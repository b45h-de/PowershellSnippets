To add an spn for a (group)managedservice account
the setspn utility has to be used as following:
example: setspn -S http/server MSA$

The examples for setting up for a user look like
this: setspn -U -S http/server User.
The -U parameter doesn't work as (group)managedservice accounts
aren't user account
