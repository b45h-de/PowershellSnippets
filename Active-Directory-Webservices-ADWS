The CMDlets for RSAT Powershell are using the Active Directory Webservices (ADWS).
Those use TCP Port 9389.
If there's a Firewall between a Computer that for example wants to use (g)msa or the
rsat cmdlets in general and the ADWS Server it might be neccessary to apply rules on
it so the computer can access adws.
