For security reasons it might make sense to prevent execution of powershell scripts that aren't signed.
Therefore a group policy could be created:
Computerconfiguration --> Administrative Templates --> Windows-Components --> Windows PowerShell --> Activate script execution --> 
activate and select "allow only signed scripts" or "local skripts and remote signed scripts allowed"
It's also possible to use the option "allow only signed scripts" and create a separate group policy that activates "local skripts and remote signed scripts allowed"
and is assigned to special servers.
If you're strict and use this option you have to make exceptions and assign the policy that allows "local skript and remote signed scripts" to some
Servers. For example Servers that use the Azure AD / Entra ID Sync Tool or for Exchangeservers.

If your're strict without the exception for exchange servers you might run into problems when you want to start the ExchangeShell.
When the Shell tries to connect to the Exchangeserver it might end up in a timeout.
If so, the reason is probably the exection policy for powershell skripts.
